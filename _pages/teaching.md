<!-- # Teaching -->

Welcome to my teaching page! Here, youâ€™ll find information about the courses I offer as part of the CSE Department at UTA and other online learning materials. 

> **Note**: My courses are designed to blend theoretical foundations with practical applications, helping students build skills that prepare them for both academic research and industry roles in AI and intelligent systems.

#### ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Course Overview**: This course introduces fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, planning, probabilistic models, machine learning, and robotics. Students learn to design intelligent systems capable of solving complex problems.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Agent design and rationality
  - Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, greedy search)
  - Game playing and adversarial search
  - Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)
  - Basics of machine learning and reinforcement learning
  - Basics of probabilistic models  
- **CSE 4308**: 2024 Fall, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:30 PM - 4:50 PM, Advanced UG Level,  [Syllabus](https://oit-ead-canvas-syllabus.s3.amazonaws.com/uta.instructure.com/2024-FALL/197918-2248-CSE-4308-002/2024-FALL_2248-CSE-4308-002.pdf).  
- **CSE 5360**: 2025 Spring, Monday and Wednesday, 4:00 PM - 5:20 PM, Graduate Level, [Syllabus]().



<!-- #### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- **Course Overview**: This course delves into the theory and application of reinforcement learning. Topics include Markov Decision Processes (MDP), policy and value iteration, Q-learning, policy gradient methods, and deep reinforcement learning.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Fundamentals of MDPs and RL
  - Policy evaluation and improvement techniques
  - Q-learning and deep Q-networks (DQNs)
  - Policy gradient and actor-critic methods
  - Applications in robotics, multi-agent systems, and intelligent transportation -->
