<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.

I am Sihong He, an **Assistant Professor in Computer Science** at **UTA**.

**I am looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students, research interns, visiting students to join my lab.** If you are passionate about related research topics, please email me your CV, transcripts, and a brief description of your research interests to my Gmail. <span style="color: #5353EC;">Please include 'Future-Maverick' in the email subject or body. (this is my email filter), and please don't send cold emails to my UTA email unless you are a UTA student.</span>

<!-- I have a [chinese-version hiring ads](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plIRQfW6pGfK2a1P1t-D0p-K053X7c7nL4XDRfk9-Ho/edit?usp=sharing), click the link to see details. -->

I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href='https://www.cse.uconn.edu'> the Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>,  <a href='https://uconn.edu'>University of Connecticut</a>, working with Dr. [Fei Miao](http://feimiao.org). Before my Ph.D. journey at UConn, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics at UC Irvine in 2019 and my B.E. degree in Financial Mathematics in 2017 at [SUSTC (南方科技大学)](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en) which was newly established in 2011 at Shenzhen, China.

<!-- I enjoy trying new things, learning new knowledge, and exploring the frontiers of research (which is also a reason why I studied in three different departments during my UG/MS/PhD life :blush:). I also serve as a reviewer/PC member for several top conferences and journals and was selected as a CPS rising star and rising star in AI in 2024. -->

<span style="color: #5353EC; text-decoration: underline;">My long-term research goal is to achieve General Embodied AI.</span> Currently, I  mainly focus on developing efficient, robust, secure, adaptive, and explainable decision-making strategies to advance General Embodied AI. My research interests include:

<body>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Reinforcement Learning (RL):</b> robust RL, multi-agent RL, federated RL, explainable RL, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):</b> smart city, intelligent transportation, connected autonomous vehicles, smart logistics, robotics, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Intelligent Decision-Making:</b> LLM/Foundation models for decision making, explainable and safe decision-making.</li>
        <li><b>Control and Optimization:</b> optimal control, robust optimization, distributionally robust optimization.</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

So far, my research has focused on robust multi-agent reinforcement learning for robust interconnected CPS, data-driven robust optimization for efficient mobile CPS, and on the security and safety of CPS. In addition to system modeling, theoretical analysis, and algorithm design, my work involves experimental validation of real-world data. My work has been published in prestigious journals and conferences including IROS, ICRA, ICML, NeurIPS, TITS, TCPS, TMC, and TMLR.
