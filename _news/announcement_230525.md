A journal paper ["Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with State Uncertainty"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=CqTkapZ6H9) is accepted to [Transactions on Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/)! :smile: We provide the first attempt at the theoretical and empirical analysis of robust MARL problem with state uncertainty in this paper.
